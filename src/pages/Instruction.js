                <p>Dear Participant,</p>
                <p>Thank you for contributing!  Because there are very few trials in this study, it is very important that you first read these directions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On each trial you will see some images flicker on and off.</li>
                    <li>Keep watching these flashes until you can find the one image that is changing.</li>
                    <li>On each trial, there is only 1 changing item, and you will know it when you find it (the changes are pretty big).</li>
                    <li>Once you are sure that you have found the changing item, PRESS THE SPACE BAR.</li>
                    <li>The picture will come back on and you then need to, CLICK THE PICTURE THAT WAS CHANGING.</li>
                    <li>Your data will only count if you click the changing item, so keep looking until you find it!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are three trials, each with different pictures.</p>
                <p>Letâ€™s do the first!</p>
